# Simple_SMTP
* SMTP is an application layer protocol. 
* The client who wants to send the mail opens a TCP connection to the SMTP server and then sends the mail across the connection.
* The SMTP server is an always-on listening mode. 
* As soon as it listens for a TCP connection from any client, the SMTP process initiates a connection through port 25. 
* After successfully establishing a TCP connection the client process sends the mail instantly.Â
